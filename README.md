# macsetup

A shell script I use to setup my mac.

Feel free to suggest other great tools!

# Getting started

Clone this repo to your mac.
```git clone git@github.com:fharper/macsetup.git```

Once cloned, you will need to give execute permission to the script. Replace the path with where you cloned the repository.
```chmod +x /path/to/script/macsetup.sh```

Now, you can run the script.
```/path/to/script/macsetup.sh```

If you are already in the repository directory, you can run simplify the command like this:
```./macsetup.sh```
